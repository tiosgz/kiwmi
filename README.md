This branch contains changes that I will eventually PR to `buffet/kiwmi` (I will have to recommit them with nicer branch history and commit messages before that) once the current PRs are all merged or closed. Until then I do not want to be held off by the speed of the main repository.

kiwmi is a work-in-progress extensive user-configurable Wayland Compositor.
kiwmi specifically does not enforce any logic, allowing for the creation of Lua-scripted behaviors, making arduous tasks such as modal window management become a breeze.
New users should be aware of the  steep learning curve present, however this will be reduced as the project matures.


## Getting Started

The dependencies required are:

- [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots)
- meson (building)
- ninja (building)
- git (build, optional)

### Building

After cloning/downloading the project and ensuring all dependencies are installed, building is as easy as running

```
$ meson build
$ ninja -C build
```

If you plan to use luajit instead, use the following commands instead.

```
$ meson -Dlua-pkg=luajit build
$ ninja -C build
```

Installing is accomplished with the following command:

```
# ninja -C build install
```
